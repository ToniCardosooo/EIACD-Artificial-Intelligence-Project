Project developed by António Cardoso and Tomás Azevedo, undergraduate students in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science,
from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto, within the scope of the curricular unit Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

Here you will find files related to the development of our Ataxx board game project, such as:
  - python file where the game was developed as well as the various algorithms for the AI ​​player
  - text files with the various tables used in the game

Before running the game, you will need to install Pygame and Numpy if it is not installed on your machine.
To do this, open the Command Prompt and type "pip install pygame" and "pip install numpy".
Check the installation of Pygame and Numpy. To run the game, open Command Prompt in a directory with all the files present here and type:
 
 python ataxx.py

Choose the game mode you like, the AI algorithm (in the case of the Human vs AI game mode) and where you want to play!
Then, a window with the game board will open, and the blue pieces will start to play.

Good game!
